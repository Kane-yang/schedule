Hello
Do you remember me
Cm
I am your long lost pen pal
Ab Bb D# Bb
It must have been ten years ago we last wrote
D#
I don’t really know what happened
Cm
I guess life came in the way
Ab Bb
Let me know if you’re still alive
Ab Bb D#
Let me know if you ever used that knife or not

Hello
Yes I remember you
Cm
I’ve got a husband and two children now
Ab Bb D# Bb
I work as an accountant and make fairly good money
D# Cm
I still have your letters, you used a pink pen to write them
Ab Bb
And you would comfort me
Ab Bb
when my tears would stain the ink
Ab Bb D# Bb
And I would send you mix tapes with Kate Bush on
Ab Bb D# Bb/D
I have to admit I sometimes lied in those letters
Cm Ab Bb Ab
Tried to make life better than it was
Bb
I still wasn’t kissed at sixteen
D#
And I still need a friend

D#
There was this letter
Cm
I never told you this back then
Ab Bb D# Bb
But it would be fair to say it saved my life
D#
I sat in the window
Cm
The only one left out from a party again
Ab Bb
Pretty sure I didn’t have a single friend
D# Bb
Then I checked the mailbox
D#
Dear long lost penpal
Cm
I was lying the whole time
Ab Bb D# Bb
I’m really a 46 years old man named Luke
D#
I have three children
Cm
and a wife, she doesn’t care
Ab Bb
And I hope you don’t resent me
Ab Bb
And I hope you do not hate me
Ab Bb D# Bb
For trying to find my way back to what it’s like to be young
Ab Bb D# Bb/D
I have to admit I sometimes lied in those letters
Cm Ab Bb Ab
Tried to make life better than it was
Bb
I still wasn’t kissed at sixteen
D#
And I still need a friend
